        <p>Hey everyone.Let me get you familiar with Git&Github and what's ReplIt about?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Git: Git is a change tracking software mechanism for recording changes(file addition,modification and deletions) occuring in code containers(in other words the places which contain code are called as repositories)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Github:Take Github as a social media website where each user can post the different code repositories they have been working on coupled with the changes made to them since they were posted on Github</p>
        <br>
        <p>ReplIt: ReplIt is a coding platform where individuals can develop websites and applications on the browser itself.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Reason for using ReplIt: <br>1) Provides an interactive programming environment within the browser which is easy to use.<br>
            2)Avoids complicated and time taking procedures of installing softwares and assisting you in developing your application from idea to product.
        </p>
        <p>I hope the above points make you realise the applications of Git and Repl.Let's see how we can connect them together.</p>

        <p class="disclaimer">This is an attempt in getting started with Repl and connecting Github along with it. Hope it helpsðŸ™‚</p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="bookmark">STEPS:</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>1) Making account on Github(https://github.com/signup) and linking it with
            ReplIt(https://replit.com/signup) by choosing "Continue with Github".You will get a prompt asking for authorization of Github with ReplIt(proceed with the default permissions and agree with it)
        </p>
        <br> 
        <p>2) Now after the authorisation process,one can see the account dashboard on the screen where different actions can be performed.For now let's make a new repl(by clicking on the "New Repl" button in the left navbar)</p>
        <br>
        <p>3) Choose the type of Repl you desire to work in and provide a name to it.Now the new repl will be launched with all the default settings.</p>
        <br>
        <p>4) Work with the files in order to develop your application.</p>
        <br>
        <p>5) After some work is done in developing the product and you want to push it to Github,then you need to click on the "version control" option where you get the option to create a new repository on Github where you can push your files(Click on "Create a Git Repo" button for this step)</p>
        <br>
        <p>6) After a few seconds the repository is set up and ready to be uploaded to Github.Now in the left navbar you can see a button showing "Connect to Github".Click on that button there you will get the option to set the visibility mode(Public or Private) and name of the repository on Github.After setting that up,you can click on the "Create Github Repository" button.</p>
        <br>
        <p>7) After performing the above steps you can view your Github profile there you can observe that the repository has been set up with all the required files.</p>
