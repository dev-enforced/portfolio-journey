        <p class="bookmark">A</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>1) Angel Investor: Angel Investors are those who will invest in your startup in the very beginning without any business model,without any revenue which is why they are called angels.</p>
        <br>
        <p>2) Average Revenue per User(ARPU): At the point that you start your revenue and how many transacting users are there,if you divide the total revenue with transacting users,you get average revenue per user.</p>
        <br>
        <p>3) Acqui Hired: If your startup doesn't do well,but the talent that you have created including you is strong,technology is very strong,then someone can acqui-hire you which means that they will not give you any money to acquire your start-up but they will absorb all the talent and the people and the technology from your startup.For this you will join that startup,you will be given a designation,a salary,you will build something independently.There will be no money or cash exit but you will have another place to build your new idea in.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>4) Acquisition: If there is acquisition then it involves a cash or stock component.It could be a start-up that acquires your start-up,they will then do that in the form of cash or stock or a combination.</p>
        <br>
        <p>5) Alpha Testing: Your product is about to be launched,but you have released a version of your product which you have internally circulated to your employees and engineers so that they can test it out, this is called alpha-testing.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="bookmark">B</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>1) Beta Testing: After alpha-testing,you will give a very basic version of your product to a few of your customers so that they can test it, so it will go outside of your company,but it will not go to the entire market,that is called a beta test or a beta version.</p>
        <br>
        <p>2) Bootstrapping: Bootstrapping means that you will not take any money from outside, you will run your start-up with your own money which could also include the contribution of friends and family.</p>
        <br>
        <p>3) Burn Rate: Burn rate means the amount of money that you lose every month as a loss.So if you are in early days and your revenue cannot fully compensate for your cost.So the number that you get when you do revenue minus total cost is called the burn rate.</p>
        <br>
        <p>4) Business Model: Business Model is an excel sheet that will clearly show that month on month,quarter on quarter,year on year,how will your business do in terms of revenue and expenses and profit/loss.This is a forward looking projection but it also includes past data,so if you already have a startup,then whatever monthly revenue and cost and thus profit/loss you have had in the past,that will be part of the business model and how do you project it in the future is part of this entire business model.</p>
        <br>
        <p>5) Business Plan: Business Planning is done along with business model,which is what is the product strategy?Who are its consumers?What is its go to market strategy?How are we going to compete with competition?Naturally,what is the business model?Based on it,how will we project what would be our valuation?How big can we become?All of that is part of the business plan which you present to someone to convince them of your business.</p>
